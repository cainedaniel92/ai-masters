### **1. Random Selection of Topics and Words**  
Explain this first to introduce the **generative process** in LDA.  

1. **Topic Assignment for Each Word:**  
   - For every word in a document, LDA assumes a topic is randomly assigned based on the document’s topic distribution (\( \theta_d \)). This means each word is influenced by a latent topic.  

2. **Word Selection from Topic:**  
   - Once a topic is assigned to a word, the model randomly selects a word from the topic’s word distribution (\( \phi_k \)). Each topic has its own distinct word probabilities.  

3. **Probabilistic Nature:**  
   - The process is completely probabilistic. The random assignment of topics and word selection introduces variability, reflecting the diversity of topics and vocabulary in real-world documents.  

4. **Latent Variables:**  
   - Both the topic assignments (\( z_n \)) and word distributions (\( \phi_k \)) are **latent variables**, meaning they are hidden and need to be inferred based on the observed words in the document.  

5. **Simulating Document Generation:**  
   - This randomness simulates how a document could be "written," with words coming from a mix of topics. Understanding this process is essential for interpreting how LDA models documents.

### **2. Modeling Topic-Document**  
Follow up with this topic to explain how documents are represented at a higher level in LDA.

1. **Documents as Mixtures of Topics:**  
   - LDA models each document as a mixture of topics. For instance, a document may be 60% about sports and 40% about health, represented by a topic distribution (\( \theta_d \)).  

2. **Topics Represented by Words:**  
   - Each topic is characterized by a unique word distribution (\( \phi_k \)). For example, the "sports" topic may have high probabilities for words like "team" and "score."  

3. **Topic Proportions from Dirichlet Distribution:**  
   - The topic proportions for each document (\( \theta_d \)) are drawn from a **Dirichlet distribution**, ensuring they are non-negative and sum to 1. This makes the proportions interpretable as probabilities.  

4. **Generating Words Using Topics:**  
   - Using the topic proportions, words in the document are generated by sampling topics and selecting words based on their associated topic distributions.  

5. **Objective of Topic Modeling:**  
   - The goal is to uncover the latent topic distributions (\( \theta \)) and the word distributions (\( \phi \)) for each topic, enabling tasks like document classification and topic discovery.
