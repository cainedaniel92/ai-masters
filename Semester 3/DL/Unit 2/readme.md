## **Unit 2: Training Deep Neural Networks**

---

### **1. Gradient Descent Algorithm - Types of Gradient Descent**
#### **Gradient Descent**:
- An optimization algorithm used to minimize a loss function by iteratively adjusting the model's weights.
- Key idea: Move in the direction of the steepest descent to reduce error.

#### **Types of Gradient Descent**:
1. **Batch Gradient Descent**:
   - Uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient.
   - **Advantage**: Stable convergence.
   - **Disadvantage**: Computationally expensive for large datasets.
   - **Example**: Updating weights after calculating the loss for all training examples.

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**:
   - Updates weights after computing the gradient for a single training example.
   - **Advantage**: Faster updates.
   - **Disadvantage**: High variance in weight updates can lead to instability.
   - **Example**: Frequently used in online learning scenarios.

3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**:
   - Divides the dataset into smaller batches and updates weights for each batch.
   - **Advantage**: Balances stability and speed.
   - **Example**: Commonly used in training deep neural networks.

#### **Real-World Application**:
- Training a recommendation system to optimize user preferences.

### **2. Weight Updates in Each Layer of a Neural Network**
- Neural networks adjust weights during training to minimize loss.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Feedforward**: Compute predictions for the input.
  2. **Calculate Loss**: Measure error using a loss function.
  3. **Backpropagation**:
     - Compute gradients of the loss with respect to weights using the chain rule.

- **Example**: Adjusting weights in a CNN to recognize handwritten digits.

### **3. Vanishing and Exploding Gradients**
#### **Vanishing Gradient**:
- Occurs when gradients become very small during backpropagation, slowing down weight updates.
- **Cause**: Use of activation functions like Sigmoid/Tanh in deep networks.
- **Solution**:
  - Use ReLU activation function.
  - Apply batch normalization.

#### **Exploding Gradient**:
- Gradients grow uncontrollably large, leading to instability in weight updates.
- **Cause**: Poor weight initialization or lack of gradient clipping.
- **Solution**:
  - Apply gradient clipping.
  - Use weight regularization techniques.

#### **Example**:
- Training a deep RNN where gradients vanish/explode, making it difficult to capture long-term dependencies.

---

### **4. Role of Weight Initialization**
- Proper weight initialization ensures faster convergence and prevents vanishing/exploding gradients.
- **Techniques**:
  1. **Random Initialization**: Assign small random values.
  2. **Xavier Initialization**: Scales weights based on the number of input and output neurons.
  3. **He Initialization**: Suitable for ReLU activation functions.

#### **Example**:
- Using He Initialization for a CNN designed to classify images of cats and dogs.

### **5. Role of Learning Factors**
- The **learning rate** (η) controls the step size during gradient descent.
- **Effect**:
  - Too small: Slow convergence.
  - Too large: Overshooting the optimal solution.

#### **Adaptive Learning Rates**:
- Adjust learning rates dynamically during training.
- **Examples**:
  1. **Adam**: Combines momentum and RMSProp.
  2. **RMSProp**: Scales learning rate for each parameter.

#### **Real-World Application**:
- Training a language translation model using an adaptive learning rate optimizer like Adam.

---

### **6. Regularization of Neural Networks**
- Prevents overfitting by adding constraints to the model during training.
- **Techniques**:
  1. **L1 Regularization**: Encourages sparsity by penalizing the absolute values of weights.
  2. **L2 Regularization**: Penalizes the square of weights (Ridge Regression).

#### **Example**:
- Applying L2 regularization to avoid overfitting in a stock price prediction model.

---

### **7. Dropout for Regularizing the Model**
- **Dropout**: Temporarily "drops out" (deactivates) random neurons during training.
- **Purpose**: Forces the network to learn robust features by preventing co-adaptation of neurons.

#### **Example**:
- Adding a dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 to a CNN for face recognition.

---

### **8. Batch Normalization**
- Normalizes inputs to each layer to have zero mean and unit variance.
- **Advantages**:
  1. Stabilizes training.
  2. Reduces dependency on weight initialization.
  3. Speeds up convergence.

#### **Example**:
- Using batch normalization in a deep neural network for text classification.

---

### **9. Hyperparameter Tuning on a Neural Network**
- Hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of layers) significantly impact model performance.
- **Techniques**:
  1. **Grid Search**: Exhaustively searches all combinations.
  2. **Random Search**: Randomly samples hyperparameters.
  3. **Bayesian Optimization**: Uses probability models to optimize hyperparameters.

#### **Example**:
- Optimizing learning rate and dropout rate for a neural network predicting customer churn.

### **Real-World Applications of Unit 2 Concepts**
1. **Healthcare**:
   - Training models for disease diagnosis.
2. **Autonomous Vehicles**:
   - Using adaptive learning rates to improve object detection accuracy.
3. **Finance**:
   - Regularizing neural networks to predict stock market trends.
