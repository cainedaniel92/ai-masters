### **Unit 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

Unit 4 explores Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a foundational concept in deep learning used primarily for image recognition and processing. Here's a detailed breakdown of each topic.

---

### **1. Convolution Neural Network (CNN)**

- **Definition**: A specialized neural network designed to process structured grid data like images.
- **Purpose**: Extract hierarchical features from images to enable tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation.

#### **Key Components**:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features (e.g., edges, textures).
2. **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine features to classify or predict.

#### **Applications**:
- Facial recognition (e.g., FaceID).
- Disease diagnosis from medical scans.

### **2. 1D, 2D, and 3D Convolutions**

#### **1D Convolution**:
- **Input**: 1D data (e.g., audio signals, time-series).
- **Use Case**: Predicting stock prices based on past trends.

#### **2D Convolution**:
- **Input**: 2D data (e.g., grayscale and color images).
- **Use Case**: Detecting objects in images.

#### **3D Convolution**:
- **Input**: 3D data (e.g., videos, volumetric data).
- **Use Case**: Analyzing medical CT scans or motion in videos.

### **3. Architecture of CNN**

#### **Key Layers**:
1. **Input Layer**: Takes raw image data (pixels).
2. **Convolutional Layer**:
   - Applies filters to extract features.
   - Produces feature maps.
3. **Activation Function**: Introduces non-linearity.
4. **Pooling Layer**: Reduces spatial dimensions.
5. **Fully Connected Layer**: Connects all neurons to finalize predictions.

#### **Example**:
- ImageNet Challenge-winning architectures like AlexNet or ResNet.

### **4. Role of Activation Functions and Max-Pooling in CNN**

#### **Activation Functions**:
- Introduce non-linearity to capture complex patterns.
- Common choices:
  - **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit): Speeds up training and avoids vanishing gradients.
  - **Sigmoid/Tanh**: Used in specific tasks requiring bounded outputs.

#### **Max-Pooling**:
- Selects the maximum value from a region in the feature map.
- **Purpose**: 
  - Reduces dimensionality.
  - Retains important features.

#### **Use Case**:
- Simplifies feature maps in object recognition tasks.

### **5. Parameter Calculation for Each Layer**

#### **Convolutional Layer Parameters**:
- Formula: \((\text{Input Size} - \text{Filter Size} + 2 \times \text{Padding}) / \text{Stride} + 1\).
- Example:
  - Input size: \(28 \times 28\), Filter size: \(3 \times 3\), Stride: \(1\), Padding: \(1\).
  - Output size: \(28 \times 28\).

#### **Fully Connected Layers**:
- Parameters = \((\text{Input Neurons} + 1) \times \text{Output Neurons}\).

### **6. Data Augmentation**

- **Definition**: A technique to artificially expand training datasets.
- **Methods**:
  - Flipping images horizontally/vertically.
  - Rotating, cropping, or scaling images.
  - Adding noise.
  
#### **Application**:
- Augmenting small datasets to improve generalization in models.

---

### **7. Regularization of CNN - Dropouts and Batch Normalization**

#### **Dropouts**:
- Randomly "drop" neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
- **Example**: Improves model performance in small datasets.

#### **Batch Normalization**:
- Normalizes inputs to layers to accelerate training and stabilize learning.
- **Example**: Ensures faster convergence in deep networks.

---

### **8. Early Stopping and Model Checkpoint**

#### **Early Stopping**:
- Halts training when validation performance stops improving.
- **Use Case**: Avoids overfitting during training.

#### **Model Checkpoint**:
- Saves the best-performing model during training.
- **Use Case**: Restores models in case of interruptions.

### **9. Case Study with CNN**

#### **Case Study**: Dog vs. Cat Classification
1. **Objective**: Classify images as either a dog or a cat.
2. **Dataset**: 10,000 images (5,000 dogs, 5,000 cats).
3. **Steps**:
   - Preprocess: Resize images to \(128 \times 128\), normalize pixel values.
   - Build CNN:
     - Input layer: \(128 \times 128 \times 3\) (RGB).
     - 2 Convolutional layers with ReLU and MaxPooling.
     - Fully connected layer with Softmax for binary classification.
   - Train and evaluate the model.
4. **Outcome**:
   - Achieved \(95\%\) accuracy, enabling reliable classification.
