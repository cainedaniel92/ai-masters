### **Unit 5: Transfer Learning and Pre-Trained Networks**

Unit 5 explores the concept of transfer learning and pre-trained networks, essential tools for leveraging existing models to solve new problems efficiently. These techniques save time, computational resources, and often lead to superior performance compared to training from scratch.

### **1. Concept of Transfer Learning**

#### **Definition**:
- Transfer learning involves reusing a model trained on one task as the starting point for a different, but related task.

#### **How It Works**:
- Pre-trained models learn generic features (e.g., edges, shapes) that are transferable to new tasks with limited data.

#### **Example**:
- Using a model trained on ImageNet to classify medical images.

#### **Applications**:
- Text sentiment analysis.
- Object detection (e.g., identifying vehicles in traffic cameras).

### **2. Architecture of Pre-Trained Networks - AlexNet and VGG**

#### **AlexNet**:
- **Introduced**: 2012, by Alex Krizhevsky.
- **Architecture**:
  - 5 Convolutional layers and 3 Fully Connected layers.
  - Uses ReLU activation and dropout for regularization.
  - First deep model to win the ImageNet challenge.
- **Application**:
  - General object detection.

#### **VGG**:
- **Introduced**: 2014, by the Visual Geometry Group.
- **Architecture**:
  - Simple design with 16 or 19 layers (e.g., VGG16, VGG19).
  - Relies on small \(3 \times 3\) filters for feature extraction.
- **Application**:
  - High-resolution image classification.

### **3. Architecture of Pre-Trained Networks - ResNet and MobileNet**

#### **ResNet (Residual Networks)**:
- **Introduced**: 2015, by Microsoft.

### **5. Transfer Learning - Feature Extraction**

#### **Definition**:
- Reusing the feature extraction layers of a pre-trained model and training only the classifier for a new task.

#### **Example**:
- Use a pre-trained ResNet for bird species classification, where only the final classification layers are retrained.

### **6. Freezing of Convolution Layers and Training of Dense Layers**

#### **Process**:
1. Freeze pre-trained layers to retain learned features.
2. Train only the final dense layers for the specific target dataset.

#### **Use Case**:
- Transfer features from ImageNet to classify plant diseases.

---

### **7. Transfer Learning - Fine Tuning**

#### **Definition**:
- Allows selective updates to pre-trained layers along with the dense layers for improving performance on the target task.

#### **Process**:
1. Unfreeze some convolution layers.
2. Apply a smaller learning rate to these layers during training.

#### **Application**:
- Fine-tuning ResNet to detect tumors in medical scans.

2. **Pre-Trained Model**: VGG16 trained on ImageNet.
3. **Steps**:
   - Freeze the convolution layers of VGG16.
   - Replace the fully connected layers to output 120 classes.
   - Train the new layers on the dog breed dataset.
4. **Outcome**:
   - Achieved \(90\%\) classification accuracy.
